# beginner-haskell-challenges

## Why?
This is supposed to be a set of simple challenges for those who are
beginning with haskell.

The goalis to make undertand recursion an inmutability implementing
the some of the most used functions is haskell such as map, filter or
fold.

The orginal idea was from [@gramosg](https://github.com/gramosg) few years ago. He wrote the
original problems in OCaml. I took those problems and translated them
to Haskell, also I included some new problems and I pretend to include
more.

This problems can be used as you want, feel free to make
suggestions or report issues (I hacve many of them :P)

## Why MyList
I decided to use my own list type to avoid things like:

```haskell
myHead = head

nyTail = tail
```

Is more gratifying to implement your own functions :D

## Solution
The solutions are in the `challenges/solutions` folder so everyone can
check them but try to solve yourself the problems, is the better way
to learn.

## ToDo
Well I would like to include more problems pregressively, it depends
on my free time :D

## Apologies
I'm sorry either if explanations are not good or some comment is bad
written, I do this on my free time, and my free time is at nights when
I am almost done and english is not my native language :)
